# NLP Projects Repository 📚

![NLP Logo](https://example.com/nlp_logo.png)

## Introduction 🎉

Welcome to the NLP Projects Repository! 🚀 In this repository, you will find a collection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects that I have worked on in the Kaggle platform. Each notebook presents a different NLP project, showcasing various techniques and approaches to solve real-world language processing challenges.

The main objective of this repository is to share knowledge, insights, and implementations related to NLP tasks. Whether you are a data scientist, NLP enthusiast, or someone looking to explore NLP techniques, this repository has something for you! 🌟

## Projects 📑

Here is a list of projects available in this repository:

1. [Project 1: AraBERT: Sentiment Analysis ](/arabic-bert-sentiment-analysis-of-tunisian-dialect%20(3).ipynb)
   - Description: In this notebook,I employ BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to harness the capabilities of ARABERT to understand and classify sentiment in text data written in Tunisian Arabic.
   - Techniques: BERT, Tokenization, Fine-Tuning, Transfer Learning, and more.

     
2. [Project 2: Named Entity Recognition (NER)](notebooks/project2_named_entity_recognition.ipynb)
   - Description: This notebook tackles the task of Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify and classify entities in text.
   - Techniques: Conditional Random Fields (CRF), Tokenization, POS Tagging, and more.
   - 
3. [Project 1: Sentiment Analysis using LSTM](notebooks/project1_sentiment_analysis_lstm.ipynb)
   - Description: This notebook demonstrates sentiment analysis using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model on a movie review dataset.
   - Techniques: AraBERT, Tokenization, and more.
