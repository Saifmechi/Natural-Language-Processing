# NLP Projects Repository 📚




## Introduction 🎉

Welcome to the NLP Projects Repository! 🚀 In this repository, you will find a collection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects that I have worked on in the Kaggle platform. Each notebook presents a different NLP project, showcasing various techniques and approaches to solve real-world language processing challenges.

The main objective of this repository is to share knowledge, insights, and implementations related to NLP tasks. Whether you are a data scientist, NLP enthusiast, or someone looking to explore NLP techniques, this repository has something for you! 🌟

## Projects 📑

Here is a list of projects available in this repository:

1. [Project 1: AraBERT: Sentiment Analysis ](/sentiment-analysis-for-tunisian-dialect-arabertt%20(5).ipynb))

   - Description: In this notebook,I employ BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to harness the capabilities of ARABERT to understand and classify sentiment in text data written in Tunisian Arabic.
   - you can find the original notebook and data :[kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/seifmechi/sentiment-analysis-of-tunisian-arabic-arabert)
   - Techniques: BERT, Tokenization, Fine-Tuning, Transfer Learning, and more.

     

2. [Sentence-BERT :Quora Question Pairs 📚](https://github.com/Saifmechi/Natural-Language-Processing/blob/main/sentiment-analysis-for-tunisian-dialect-arabertt%20(5).ipynb)
   - Description:Implemented advanced Natural Language Processing techniques to classify duplicate question pairs on Quora, addressing the platform's challenge of redundancy. Utilized machine learning and deep learning models, including cutting-edge solutions such as BERT and Word2Vec, to optimize Quora's question and answer ecosystem.
   - Techniques:  EDA, feature engineering,deep learning,transformers,araBERT.

3. [Project 2: Named Entity Recognition (NER)](notebooks/project2_named_entity_recognition.ipynb)
   - Description: This notebook tackles the task of Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify and classify entities in text.
   - Techniques: Conditional Random Fields (CRF), Tokenization, POS Tagging, and more.
